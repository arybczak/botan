# Welcome to botan

<!-- TODO: Badges: hackage)  -->

![CI](https://github.com/apotheca/botan/actions/workflows/CI.yml/badge.svg)

`botan` is a set of Haskell bindings for the [Botan](https://botan.randombit.net/) cryptography library.

> Botan's goal is to be the best option for cryptography in C++ by offering the tools necessary to implement a range of practical systems, such as TLS protocol, X.509 certificates, modern AEAD ciphers, PKCS#11 and TPM hardware support, password hashing, and post quantum crypto schemes.

# Introduction

This project has the goal of providing a set of safe and performant bindings to the Botan C++ cryptography library via its C FFI (Foreign Function Interface). It does this by providing 3 libraries at varying levels of complexity and abstraction:

- `botan-bindings` contains raw bindings with buffers and pointers, and is otherwise an almost a 1:1 translation of the C FFI into Haskell
- `botan-low` contains low-level bindings with imperative IO and exceptions, and safely wraps buffers and pointers into bytestrings and autoreleased objects
- `botan` contains high-level bindings with strong types and idiomatic Haskell, and provides algebraic data types and convenience functions

We suggest using the highest-level library possible, unless you wish to build your own abstraction over the Botan C++ library. The highest-level stable library is currently: `botan-low`

<details>

<summary>Features</summary>

This library provides its bindings through the Botan C FFI, which does not currently cover the entire range of features available in C++. As such, it provides a sizeable yet limited subset of those features.

These bindings provide the following features:

- Random number generators
- Hashing and non-cryptographic checksums
- Message authentication codes
- Block, mode, and AEAD ciphers
- Password hashing and key derivation functions
- Hash- and time-based one-time passwords
- Post-quantum crypto schemes
- SRP6 password authenticated key exchange
- X.509 certificate systems (experimental)
- ZFEC forward error correction

> NOTE: This project includes efforts to expand this subset of features through a fork of the Botan C++ library - see [Enabling experimental support](#Enabling-experimental-support) for more details. This fork will be contributed back to the original library when it becomes sufficiently stable.

# Installation

This library requires Botan 3 to be installed in order to work. See [Building the Library](https://botan.randombit.net/handbook/building.html) in the handbook for more details.

## Unix package

~~Botan is available already in nearly all [packaging systems](https://repology.org/project/botan/versions) so you can probably install it through your distribution / system package manager.~~

At current, Botan **2** is readily available, but Botan **3** is not yet available as a prebuilt linux package. Please see 'Building from source'.

<details><summary>Arch</summary>

> Untested.

```shell
pacman -S botan
# or maybe
pacman -S botan3
```
    
</details>

<details><summary>Debian</summary>

> Untested.

```shell
apt-get update
apt-get install botan
```

</details>

<details><summary>Red Hat</summary>

> Untested.

```shell
yum update
yum install botan
```

</details>

<details><summary>Ubuntu</summary>

> Untested.

```shell
sudo apt update
sudo apt install botan
```

</details>

## MacOS package

Botan is available through the [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) package manager:

<details><summary>Homebrew</summary>

```shell
brew install botan
```

</details>

## From source

Botan can be built from source, for additional configuration options and customization.

<details><summary>Build from source</summary>

First, clone the Botan C++ repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/randombit/botan
```

Botanâ€™s build configuration is controlled by `configure.py`, and requires Python 3.x or later.

This works for most systems:

```shell
./configure.py [--prefix=/some/directory]
make
make install
```

If you wish to run unit tests before installation, run `make check` before `make install`.

On platforms that do not understand the `#!` convention for beginning script files, or that have Python installed in an unusual spot, you might need to prefix the `configure.py` command with `python3` or `/path/to/python`:

```shell
python3 ./configure.py [arguments]
```

The `make install` target has a default directory in which it will install Botan (typically `/usr/local`). You can override this by using the `--prefix` argument to `configure.py`, like so:

```shell
./configure.py --prefix=/botan [arguments]
```

Some features rely on third party libraries which your system might not have or that you might not want the resulting binary to depend on. For instance to enable `sqlite3` support, add `--with-sqlite3` to your invocation of `configure.py`.

```shell
./configure.py --with-sqlite3 [arguments]
```

</details>

## Windows from source

Prebuilt botan is not available for windows, and it must be built from source. The process is similar to building from source in Unix or MacOS.

<details><summary>Windows from source</summary>

> Untested.

You need to have a copy of Python installed, and have both Python and your chosen compiler in your path. Open a command shell (or the SDK shell), and run:

```shell
python3 configure.py --cc=msvc --os=windows
nmake
nmake check
nmake install
```

Alternately, starting in Botan 3.2, there is additionally support for using the ninja build tool as an alternative to nmake:

```shell
python3 configure.py --cc=msvc --os=windows --build-tool=ninja
ninja
ninja check
ninja install
```

For MinGW, use:

```shell
python3 configure.py --cc=gcc --os=mingw
make
```

By default the install target will be `C:\botan`; you can modify this with the `--prefix` option.

When building your applications, all you have to do is tell the compiler to look for both include files and library files in C:\botan, and it will find both. Or you can move them to a place where they will be in the default compiler search paths (consult your documentation and/or local expert for details).

# Usage

You will need to add `botan` as a package dependency in order to use it.

<details><summary>Cabal</summary>

This package is not yet available on hackage, so you'll have to add the repo to your `cabal.project` file using a `source-repository-package` stanza:

```
source-repository-package
    type: git
    location: git://github.com/apotheca/botan.git
    tag: [commit-hash]
```

Then, add it to your `[project].cabal` under the `build-depends` stanza:

```
build-depends:
    botan-low
```

If you installed botan in a non-standard location, you may need to specify where using `--extra-include-dirs` and `--extra-lib-dirs` flags:

```shell
cabal repl TARGET --extra-include-dirs /botan/include --extra-lib-dirs /botan/lib
```

You can add these flags permanently to your `cabal.project` or `cabal.project.local` file:

```
extra-include-dirs:
- /botan/include
extra-lib-dirs:
- /botan/lib
```

</details>

<details><summary>Stack</summary>

> Untested.

This package is not yet available on stackage, so you'll have to add the repo to your `stack.yaml` file under the `extra-deps` stanza:

```
extra-deps:
- github: apotheca/botan
  commit: [commit-hash]
```

Then, add it to your `package.yaml` file under the `dependencies` stanza:

```
dependencies:
- botan-low
```

If you installed botan in a non-standard location, you may need to specify where using `--extra-include-dirs` and `--extra-lib-dirs` flags:

```shell
stack repl TARGET --extra-include-dirs /botan/include --extra-lib-dirs /botan/lib
```

You can add these flags permanently to your `stack.yaml` or global `config.yaml` file:

```
extra-include-dirs:
- /botan/include
extra-lib-dirs:
- /botan/lib
```

</details>

After you have added `botan` as a dependency, you can begin importing modules and using them in your code.

```haskell
import Botan.Low.Hash

main = do
    hash <- hashInit "SHA-256"
    digest <- hashUpdateFinalize hash "Fee fi fo fum!"
    print digest
```

# Tutorials

<!-- There are no tutorials available at this time. For the moment, the unit tests are your best bet for an example of working code. -->

There are many tutorials available, with at-a-glance references in this README, and complete in-depth articles in the [tutorials folder](tutorials/).

<details><summary>Hashes</summary>

The easiest way to hash is to use a fixed hash algorithm directly. `sha3_512` is the suggested hash algorithm, unless you specifically need another, different algorithm.

```haskell
import Botan.Hash.SHA3
sha3_512 "Fee fi fo fum!"
-- 03a240a2...
```

If an algorithm has variants, you may use a family-level function such as `sha3`, and select the variant with `TypeApplications`:

```haskell
-- This produces the same digest as before
sha3 @512 "Fee fi fo fum!"
-- Explicit typing also works
sha3 "Fee fi fo fum!" :: SHA3Digest 512
```

These functions are implemented via a more generic, classy `Hash` interface which uses the `Digest` data family to ensure that different algorithms and variants have different types while still being inferred properly.

```haskell
-- Once more at the class-level
hash @(SHA3 512) "Fee fi fo fum!"
-- Once more with explicit typing
hash "Fee fi fo fum!" :: Digest (SHA3 512)
```

For a more in-depth look, see the full [Hash](tutorials/Hash.md) tutorial.

# Enabling experimental support

Some features rely on an experimental fork of the Botan C++ library, which will be contributed back upstream to Botan C++ when it is stable.

<details><summary>Build with experimental features</summary>

1.  Clone the experimental [fork](https://github.com/apotheca/botan-upstream)

```shell
git clone https://github.com/apotheca/botan-upstream $BOTAN_CPP
```

2.  Build and install the experimental fork as [from source](#From-source). You may wish to install to a non-standard location using `--prefix` during configuration, to avoid overwriting any pre-existing install.

```shell
cd $BOTAN_CPP
./configure.py --prefix=$BOTAN_OUT
make
make install
```

3.  Use the `XFFI` flag to enable the experimental FFI modules. If you installed the experimental fork to a non-standard location, you may also need to specify where using `--extra-include-dirs` and `--extra-lib-dirs` flags.

```shell
cd $BOTAN_HASKELL
cabal build TARGET -fXFFI --extra-include-dirs $BOTAN_OUT/include --extra-lib-dirs $BOTAN_OUT/lib
# or
stack build TARGET --flag XFFI --extra-include-dirs $BOTAN_OUT/include --extra-lib-dirs $BOTAN_OUT/lib
```

To check that you've done everything correctly, you can run the following:

```
import Botan.Bindings.Version 
import Foreign.C.String
import Prelude
botan_version_string >>= peekCString
```

The version will say `unreleased` if it is properly pointing to our built Botan.
