![CI](https://github.com/apotheca/botan/actions/workflows/CI.yml/badge.svg)

`botan` is a set of Haskell bindings for the [Botan](https://botan.randombit.net/) cryptography library.

> Botan's goal is to be the best option for cryptography in C++ by offering the tools necessary to implement a range of practical systems, such as TLS protocol, X.509 certificates, modern AEAD ciphers, PKCS#11 and TPM hardware support, password hashing, and post quantum crypto schemes.

# Introduction

This project has the goal of providing a set of safe and performant bindings to the Botan C++ cryptography library via its C FFI (Foreign Function Interface). It does this by providing 3 libraries at varying levels of complexity and abstraction:

- `botan-bindings` contains raw bindings with buffers and pointers, and is otherwise an almost a 1:1 translation of the C FFI into Haskell
- `botan-low` contains low-level bindings with imperative IO and exceptions, and safely wraps buffers and pointers into bytestrings and autoreleased objects
- `botan` contains high-level bindings with strong types and idiomatic Haskell, and provides algebraic data types and convenience functions

We suggest using the highest-level library possible, unless you wish to build your own abstraction over the Botan C++ library. The highest-level stable library is currently: `botan-low`

<details>

<summary>Features</summary>

This library provides its bindings through the Botan C FFI, which does not currently cover the entire range of features available in C++. As such, it provides a sizeable yet limited subset of those features.

These bindings provide the following features:

- Random number generators
- Hashing and non-cryptographic checksums
- Message authentication codes
- Block, mode, and AEAD ciphers
- Password hashing and key derivation functions
- Hash- and time-based one-time passwords
- Post-quantum crypto schemes
- SRP6 password authenticated key exchange
- X.509 certificate systems (experimental)
- ZFEC forward error correction

> NOTE: This project includes efforts to expand this subset of features through a fork of the Botan C++ library - see [Enabling experimental support](#Enabling-experimental-support) for more details. This fork will be contributed back to the original library when it becomes sufficiently stable.

# Installation

This library requires Botan 3 to be installed in order to work. See [Building the Library](https://botan.randombit.net/handbook/building.html) in the handbook for more details.

## Unix package

~~Botan is available already in nearly all [packaging systems](https://repology.org/project/botan/versions) so you can probably install it through your distribution / system package manager.~~

At current, Botan **2** is readily available, but Botan **3** is not yet available as a prebuilt linux package. Please see 'Building from source'.

<details><summary>Arch</summary>

> Untested.

```shell
pacman -S botan
# or maybe
pacman -S botan3
```
    
</details>

<details><summary>Debian</summary>

> Untested.

```shell
apt-get update
apt-get install botan
```

</details>

<details><summary>Red Hat</summary>

> Untested.

```shell
yum update
yum install botan
```

</details>

<details><summary>Ubuntu</summary>

> Untested.

```shell
sudo apt update
sudo apt install botan
```

</details>

## MacOS package

Botan is available through the [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) package manager:

<details><summary>Homebrew</summary>

```shell
brew install botan
```

</details>

## From source

Botan can be built from source, for additional configuration options and customization.

<details><summary>Build from source</summary>

First, clone the Botan C++ repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/randombit/botan
```

Botanâ€™s build configuration is controlled by `configure.py`, and requires Python 3.x or later.

This works for most systems:

```shell
./configure.py [--prefix=/some/directory]
make
make install
```

If you wish to run unit tests before installation, run `make check` before `make install`.

On platforms that do not understand the `#!` convention for beginning script files, or that have Python installed in an unusual spot, you might need to prefix the `configure.py` command with `python3` or `/path/to/python`:

```shell
python3 ./configure.py [arguments]
```

The `make install` target has a default directory in which it will install Botan (typically `/usr/local`). You can override this by using the `--prefix` argument to `configure.py`, like so:

```shell
./configure.py --prefix=/botan [arguments]
```

Some features rely on third party libraries which your system might not have or that you might not want the resulting binary to depend on. For instance to enable `sqlite3` support, add `--with-sqlite3` to your invocation of `configure.py`.

```shell
./configure.py --with-sqlite3 [arguments]
```

</details>

## Windows from source

Prebuilt botan is not available for windows, and it must be built from source. The process is similar to building from source in Unix or MacOS.

<details><summary>Windows from source</summary>

> Untested.

You need to have a copy of Python installed, and have both Python and your chosen compiler in your path. Open a command shell (or the SDK shell), and run:

```shell
python3 configure.py --cc=msvc --os=windows
nmake
nmake check
nmake install
```

Alternately, starting in Botan 3.2, there is additionally support for using the ninja build tool as an alternative to nmake:

```shell
python3 configure.py --cc=msvc --os=windows --build-tool=ninja
ninja
ninja check
ninja install
```

For MinGW, use:

```shell
python3 configure.py --cc=gcc --os=mingw
make
```

By default the install target will be `C:\botan`; you can modify this with the `--prefix` option.

When building your applications, all you have to do is tell the compiler to look for both include files and library files in C:\botan, and it will find both. Or you can move them to a place where they will be in the default compiler search paths (consult your documentation and/or local expert for details).

</details>

# Usage

You will need to add `botan` as a package dependency in order to use it.

<details><summary>Cabal</summary>

This package is not yet available on hackage, so you'll have to add the repo to your `cabal.project` file using a `source-repository-package` stanza:

```
source-repository-package
    type: git
    location: git://github.com/apotheca/botan.git
    tag: [commit-hash]
```

Then, add it to your `[project].cabal` under the `build-depends` stanza:

```
build-depends:
    botan-low
```

If you installed botan in a non-standard location, you may need to specify where using `--extra-include-dirs` and `--extra-lib-dirs` flags:

```shell
cabal repl TARGET --extra-include-dirs /botan/include --extra-lib-dirs /botan/lib
```

You can add these flags permanently to your `cabal.project` or `cabal.project.local` file:

```
extra-include-dirs:
- /botan/include
extra-lib-dirs:
- /botan/lib
```

</details>

<details><summary>Stack</summary>

> Untested.

This package is not yet available on stackage, so you'll have to add the repo to your `stack.yaml` file under the `extra-deps` stanza:

```
extra-deps:
- github: apotheca/botan
  commit: [commit-hash]
```

Then, add it to your `package.yaml` file under the `dependencies` stanza:

```
dependencies:
- botan-low
```

If you installed botan in a non-standard location, you may need to specify where using `--extra-include-dirs` and `--extra-lib-dirs` flags:

```shell
stack repl TARGET --extra-include-dirs /botan/include --extra-lib-dirs /botan/lib
```

You can add these flags permanently to your `stack.yaml` or global `config.yaml` file:

```
extra-include-dirs:
- /botan/include
extra-lib-dirs:
- /botan/lib
```

</details>

After you have added `botan` as a dependency, you can begin importing modules and using them in your code.

```haskell
import Botan.Low.Hash

main = do
    hash <- hashInit "SHA-256"
    digest <- hashUpdateFinalize hash "Fee fi fo fum!"
    print digest
```

# Tutorials

<details><summary>Botan.Low.Bcrypt</summary>

`bcrypt` is a password-hashing algorithm designed to protect your passwords against hackers using an expensive key setup phase. Instead of storing a user's password in plaintext in the database, the server may instead generate a salted bcrypt digest upon signup, and verify it upon login. 

The `bcrypt` implementation provided by `botan` generates a random salt for you automatically. A work factor of 12 or greater is recommended.

To generate a bcrypt digest:

```haskell
import Botan.Low.RNG
import Botan.Low.Bcrypt

-- The user has sent us a username and password in order to sign up 
onUserSignup :: ByteString -> ByteString -> IO ()
onUserSignup username password = do
    rng <- rngInit "user"
    digest <- bcryptGenerate password rng 12
    createAndStoreNewUser username digest
```

To validate a bcrypt digest:

```haskell
import Botan.Low.RNG
import Botan.Low.Bcrypt

-- The user has sent us a username and password in order to log in
onUserLogin :: ByteString -> ByteString -> IO Bool
onUserLogin username password = do
    rng <- rngInit "user"
    digestMaybe <- getStoredUserDigest username
    case digestMaybe of
        Nothing     -> return False
        Just digest -> bcryptIsValid password digest
```

</details>

<details><summary>Botan.Low.BlockCipher</summary>

A `block cipher` is a deterministic, cryptographic primitive suitable for encrypting or decrypting a single, fixed-size block of data at a time. Block ciphers are used as building blocks for more complex cryptographic operations. If you are looking to encrypt user data, you are probably looking for `Botan.Low.Cipher` instead.

Unless you need a specific block cipher, it is strongly recommended that you use the `AES256` algorithm.

```haskell
import Botan.Low.BlockCipher
blockCipher <- blockCipherInit AES256
```

To use a block cipher, we first need to generate (if we haven't already) a secret key.

```haskell
import Botan.Low.RNG
rng <- rngInit "user"
-- We will use the maximum key size; AES256 keys are always 16 bytes
(_,keySize,_) <- blockCipherGetKeyspec blockCipher
-- Block cipher keys are randomly generated
key <- rngGet rng keySize
```

After the key is generated, we must set it as the block cipher key:

```haskell
blockCipherSetKey blockCipher key
```

To encrypt a message, it must be a multiple of the block size.

```haskell
blockSize <- blockCipherBlockSize blockCipher
-- AES256 block size is always 16 bytes
message = "0000DEADBEEF0000" :: ByteString
ciphertext <- blockCipherEncryptBlocks blockCipher message
```

To decrypt a message, simply reverse the process:

```haskell
plaintext <- blockCipherDecryptBlocks blockCipher ciphertext
message == plaintext -- True
```

</details>

<details><summary>Botan.Low.Cipher</summary>

A `cipher` mode is a cryptographic algorithm suitable for encrypting and decrypting large quantities of arbitrarily-sized data. An `aead` is a cipher mode that also used to provide authentication of the ciphertext, potentially with plaintext `associated data`.

Unless you need a specific `cipher` or `aead`, it is strongly recommended that you use the `cbcMode AES256 PKCS7` and `gcmMode AES256` (or `ChaCha20Poly1305`) algorithms respectively.

```haskell
import Botan.Low.Cipher
encrypter <- cipherInit ChaCha20Poly1305 Encrypt
```

To use a cipher, we first need to generate (if we haven't already) a secret key.

```haskell
import Botan.Low.RNG
rng <- rngInit "user"
-- We will use the maximum key size; ChaCha20Poly1305 keys are always 32 bytes
(_,keySize,_) <- cipherGetKeyspec encrypter
-- Block cipher keys are randomly generated
key <- rngGet rng keySize
```

After the key is generated, we must set it as the cipher key:

```haskell
cipherSetKey encrypter key
```

If the cipher is an `aead`, we may also set the `associated data`:

```haskell
cipherSetAssociatedData encrypter "Fee fi fo fum!"
```

To ensure that the key is not leaked, we should generate a new nonce for every encryption. The range of allowed nonce sizes depends on the specific algorithm.

```haskell
import Botan.Low.RNG
-- The default ChaCha20Poly1305 nonce is always 12 bytes.
nonceSize <- cipherGetDefaultNonceLength encrypter
nonce <- rngGet rng nonceSize
```

To encrypt a message, it must be a multiple of the block size. If the cipher was an aead, the authentication tag will automatically be included in the ciphertext

```haskell
-- Rarely, some cipher modes require that the message size be aligned to the block size
-- Consult algorithm-specific documentation if this occurs. 
message = "I smell the blood of an Englishman!"
cipherStart encrypter nonce
ciphertext <- cipherEncrypt encrypter message
```

To decrypt a message, we run the same process with a decrypter, using the same `key` and `nonce` to decode the `ciphertext`:

```haskell
decrypter <- cipherInit ChaCha20Poly1305 Decrypt
cipherSetKey decrypter key
cipherSetAssociatedData decrypter "Fee fi fo fum!"
cipherStart decrypter nonce
plaintext <- cipherDecrypt decrypter ciphertext
message == plaintext -- True
```

You can completely clear a cipher's state, leaving it ready for reuse:

```haskell
cipherClear encrypter
-- You'll have to set the key, nonce, (and ad, if aead) again.
cipherSetKey encrypter anotherKey
cipherStart encrypter anotherNonce
cipherSetAssociatedData encrypter anotherAD
-- Process another message
anotherCiphertext <- cipherEncrypt encrypter anotherMessage
```

If you are encrypting or decrypting multiple messages with the same key, you can reset the cipher instead of clearing it, leaving the key set:

```haskell
cipherClear encrypter
-- This is equivalent to calling cipherClear followed by cipherSetKey with the original key.
-- You'll have to set the nonce  (and ad, if aead) again, but not the key.
cipherStart encrypter anotherNonce
cipherSetAssociatedData encrypter anotherAD
-- Process another message with the same key
anotherCiphertext <- cipherEncrypt encrypter anotherMessage
```

<details><summary>Botan.Low.Hash</summary>

A `hash` is deterministic, one-way function suitable for producing a deterministic, fixed-size digest from an arbitrarily-sized message, which is used to verify the integrity of the data.

Unless you need a specific `hash`, it is strongly recommended that you use the `SHA3` algorithm.

```haskell
import Botan.Low.Hash
hash <- hashInit SHA3
message = "Fee fi fo fum!"
hashUpdate hash message
digest <- hashFinal hash
```

You can verify a digest by hashing the message a second time, and comparing the two:

```haskell
rehash <- hashInit SHA3
hashUpdate rehash message
redigest <- hashFinal rehash
digest == redigest -- True
```

You can clear a hash's state, leaving it ready for reuse:

```haskell
hashClear hash
-- Process another message
hashUpdate hash anotherMessage
anotherDigest <- hashFinal hash
```

<details><summary>Botan.Low.MAC</summary>

A `mac` (or message authentication code) is a cryptographic algorithm that uses a secret key to produce a fixed-size digest from an arbitrarily-sized message, which is then used to verify the integrity and authenticity of the data.

Unless you need a specific `mac`, it is strongly recommended that you use the `hmac SHA3` algorithm.

```haskell
import Botan.Low.MAC
import Botan.Low.Hash
mac <- macInit (hmac SHA3)
```

To use a MAC, we first need to generate (if we haven't already) a secret key.

```haskell
import Botan.Low.RNG
rng <- rngInit "user"
-- HMAC allows for an arbitrary key size, but we can check the key spec if necessary
(keyMin,keyMax,keyMod) <- macGetKeyspec mac
-- MAC are randomly generated; 32 bytes is acceptable
key <- rngGet rng 32
```

After the key is generated, we must set it as the mac key:

```haskell
macSetKey mac key
```

Then, we may produce an authentication code from a message using the secret key:

```haskell
macUpdate mac "Fee fi fo fum!"
auth <- macFinal mac
```

To verify an message authentication code, we can reproduce it using the secret key and message, and then check for equality:

```haskell
verify <- macInit (hmac SHA3)
macSetKey verify key
macUpdate verify "Fee fi fo fum!"
verifyAuth <- macFinal verify
auth == verifyAuth -- True
```

You can completely clear a mac's state, leaving it ready for reuse:

```haskell
macClear mac
-- You'll have to set the key again
macSetKey mac anotherKey
-- Process another message
macUpdate mac anotherMessage
anotherAuth <- macFinal mac
```

Some algorithms (GMAC, Poly1305) have additional requirements for use. Avoid if possible, and consult algorithm-specific documentation for GMAC and Poly1305. If you must use GMAC, a nonce needs to be set:

```haskell
mac <- macInit (gmac AES256)
k <- systemRNGGet 32
n <- systemRNGGet 32    -- Here
macSetKey mac k
macSetNonce mac n       -- Here
macUpdate mac "Fee fi fo fum!"
auth <- macFinal mac
```

<!-- <details><summary>Botan.Low.MPI</summary>

</details> -->

<details><summary>Botan.Low.PubKey</summary>

Unless you need a specific `public key cryptosystem`, it is strongly recommended that you use the `RSA`, `Ed25519`, or `Curve25519` algorithms, depending on your desired operation.

Create an RSA keypair:

```haskell
import Botan.Low.RNG
import Botan.Low.PubKey
rng <- rngInit "user"
-- Alice generates her keys
alicePrivKey <- privKeyCreate RSA "4096" rng
alicePubKey <- privKeyExportPubKey alicePrivKey
```

> NOTE: For algorithm-specific parameters, consult the Botan documentation and source

Encrypt a message:

```haskell
import Botan.Low.PubKey.Encrypt
message = "Fee fi fo fum!"
-- Bob encrypts a message for Alice using her public key
-- Unlike `Crypto.Saltine.Core.Box`, the message is only encrypted, not signed.
encrypter <- encryptCreate alicePubKey EME_PKCS1_v1_5
ciphertext <- encrypt encrypter rng message
```

> NOTE: For algorithm-specific padding parameters, consult the Botan documentation and source

Decrypt a message:

```haskell
import Botan.Low.PubKey.Decrypt
-- Alice decrypts the message from Bob using her private key
decrypter <- decryptCreate alicePrivKey EME_PKCS1_v1_5
plaintext <- decrypt decrypter ciphertext
message == plaintext -- True
```

> NOTE: The same padding must be used for both encryption and decryption

Sign a message:

```haskell
import Botan.Low.PubKey.Sign
import Botan.Low.Hash
message = "Fee fi fo fum!"
-- Alice signs the message using her private key
signer <- signCreate alicePrivKey (emsa_emsa4 SHA3) SigningPEMFormatSignature
signUpdate signer message
sig <- signFinish signer rng
```

> NOTE: Signing uses a different set of padding algorithms `EMSA` from encryption `EME`, and different signing / encryption algorithms support different specific padding algorithms

> NOTE: Signing does not yet have proper constants for selecting a padding mechanism. For more information, refer to the `Botan.PubKey`, `Botan.PubKey.Sign`, or the Botan C++ documentation. This area will be improved in the near future.

Verify a message:

```haskell
import Botan.Low.PubKey.Verify
-- Bob verifies the message using Alice's public key
verifier <- verifyCreate alicePubKey (emsa_emsa4 SHA3) SigningPEMFormatSignature
verifyUpdate verifier message
verified <- verifyFinish verifier sig
verified -- True
```

> NOTE: The same padding must be used for both encryption and decryption

</details>

<details><summary>Botan.Low.RNG</summary>

A `random number generator` is used to generate uniform samples of pseudorandom bytes.

You can always use the system `RNG`:

```haskell
import Botan.Low.RNG
randomBytes <- systemRNGGet 16
```

Unless you need a specific `RNG`, it is strongly recommended that you use the autoseeded `user` RNG.

```haskell
import Botan.Low.RNG
rng <- rngInit "user"
randomBytes <- rngGet rng 16
```

You can reseed a generator using the system generator:

```haskell
rngReseed rng 64
```

You can also reseed a generator using a specific generator:

```haskell
systemRNG <- rngInit "system"
rngReseedFromRNG rng systemRNG 64
```

You can also seed it with your own entropy; this is safe and can never *decrease* the amount of entropy in the generator.

```haskell
rngAddEntropy rng "Fee fi fo fum!"
```

# Enabling experimental support

Some features rely on an experimental fork of the Botan C++ library, which will be contributed back upstream to Botan C++ when it is stable.

<details><summary>Build with experimental features</summary>

1.  Clone the experimental [fork](https://github.com/apotheca/botan-upstream)

```shell
git clone https://github.com/apotheca/botan-upstream $BOTAN_CPP
```

2.  Build and install the experimental fork as [from source](#From-source). You may wish to install to a non-standard location using `--prefix` during configuration, to avoid overwriting any pre-existing install.

```shell
cd $BOTAN_CPP
./configure.py --prefix=$BOTAN_OUT
make
make install
```

3.  Use the `XFFI` flag to enable the experimental FFI modules. If you installed the experimental fork to a non-standard location, you may also need to specify where using `--extra-include-dirs` and `--extra-lib-dirs` flags.

```shell
cd $BOTAN_HASKELL
cabal build TARGET -fXFFI --extra-include-dirs $BOTAN_OUT/include --extra-lib-dirs $BOTAN_OUT/lib
# or
stack build TARGET --flag XFFI --extra-include-dirs $BOTAN_OUT/include --extra-lib-dirs $BOTAN_OUT/lib
```

To check that you've done everything correctly, you can run the following:

```
import Botan.Bindings.Version 
import Foreign.C.String
import Prelude
botan_version_string >>= peekCString
```

The version will say `unreleased` if it is properly pointing to our built Botan.
